**Title:** EVEMon Lives - New Maintainer, v5.1.0 Released

---

Hello capsuleers,

I'm Alia Collins, and I've taken over maintenance of EVEMon from Peter Han.

EVEMon is back and fully working. Rebuilt from the ground up on .NET 8.

**What's New in v5.1.0:**

- **Migrated to .NET 8** - Modern framework, better performance, proper connection handling
- **ESI Best Practices** - Proper rate limiting, caching, and error handling so your requests don't get blocked
- **Catalyst Expansion SDE** - All game data updated (December 2025)
- **Booster Simulation** - See how boosters affect your training time in attribute optimizer
- **Better Status Bar** - Shows exactly which API is refreshing next (e.g., "Skills: 00:02:45")
- **New UI Experiments** - Check out the About window (Help → About) for a preview of where the UI is heading
- **Auto-Update Notifications** - EVEMon now checks for updates from the new repo

**Stability Note:** This is a major rebuild. Everything worked fine in my testing, but please expect some stability issues as we shake things out. Report anything you find.

**Beta Channel:** There's also a rolling beta release for those who want the latest features. Expect high velocity updates as I get more time to work on this.

Download, extract, run. No installer.

**Latest Stable:** v5.1.0
**GitHub:** https://github.com/aliacollins/evemon
