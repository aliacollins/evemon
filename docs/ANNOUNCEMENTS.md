Hello capsuleers,

I'm Alia Collins, and I've taken over maintenance of EVEMon from Peter Han.

EVEMon is back and fully working. Rebuilt from the ground up on .NET 8.

**What's New:**

- **Migrated to .NET 8** - Modern framework, better performance, proper connection handling
- **ESI Best Practices** - Proper rate limiting, caching, and error handling so your requests don't get blocked
- **Catalyst Expansion SDE** - All game data updated (December 2025)
- **Booster Simulation** - See how boosters affect your training time in attribute optimizer
- **Better Status Bar** - Shows exactly which API is refreshing next (e.g., "Skills: 00:02:45")

Download, extract, run. No installer.

**Latest:** v5.0.3
**GitHub:** https://github.com/aliacollins/evemon
