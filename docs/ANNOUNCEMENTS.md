**Title:** EVEMon Lives - New Maintainer

---

Hello capsuleers,

I'm Alia Collins, and I've taken over maintenance of EVEMon from Peter Han.

EVEMon is back and working again. If you've had issues with the old version, give it another try.

**What's fixed:**
- Connection failures that made it unusable
- Settings errors on every launch
- Clone locations showing blank
- Skill queue data not updating properly

**What's new:**
- Booster simulation in attribute optimizer
- See exactly which API call is refreshing next
- All game data rebuilt from latest SDE

Download, extract, run. No installer.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/aliacollins/evemon

Just download, extract, and run.
